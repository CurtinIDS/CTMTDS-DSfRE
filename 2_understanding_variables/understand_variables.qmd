# Data

## Data: what is it?

:::: {.columns}

::: {.column width="50%"}

:::

::: {.column width="50%"}

:::{style="font-size: 95%"}
* Measurements?
* Elementary particles of knowledge?
* Digital records?
* Pure information?
* In everyday usage: a jumble of notions about information, science, and knowledge

## Is data really raw?

* We often speak of “raw” data and see it as independent of human judgement
  * But is it?
* This "independence" is the source of “data-driven” decision-making
* The purported freedom of data from human subjectivity invests it with agency: "Let the data speak for itself", or "The data doesn’t lie"

## Is lots of data enough?

:::: {.columns}

::: {.column width="40%"}
"We can throw the numbers into the biggest computing clusters the world has ever seen and let statistical algorithms find patterns where science cannot."

## Data: caveats

* How data are recorded and collected is the result of human decisions about what to measure, when and where to do so, and by what methods
* "Raw" data signifies that no processing took place following data collection, but the term obscures the steps that took place before even this data was collected
* "All data is cooked" (Barrowman, 2018)
* True in scientific as well as sociological contexts

## Observational/experimental data

* **Experimental** data: in properly conducted experiments, we can ascribe causality as in clinical trials, for example:
  * Experiments conducted using a sample from a population
* **Observational** data: passively observed or measured; cannot ascribe causality
  * **correlation is not causation**
* Big data: we happen to have a lot more observational data now:
  * Velocity, variety, and volume

## Errors and inconsistencies {.smaller}

#### Measurement errors

::: { style="overflow: hidden"}
* Random errors can arise from the measurement devices.
* If they are truly random, the average of many measurements will be a sensible estimate of the 'true' value
:::

#### Systematic errors

* Systematic errors are not random and introduce a **bias** into the measurements.
* Systematic errors _will not_ average out to the 'true' value.
* Types of systematic errors:
  * Offset errors (e.g., measurement equipment is not correctly zeroed)
  * Scaling errors (e.g., measurements are incorrectly scaled by a factor)
  * Time-dependent offset (drift)

# Variable types

## Numerical and categorical variables

![](images/Continuous_categorical.png)

## Numerical and categorical variables {.smaller}

* Numerical
  * The volume of a solvent in a pressure vessel (C)
  * The mass of bauxite being crushed (C)
  * The temperature inside a kiln (C)
  * The number of kilns (D)
* Categorical: having distinct values:
  * The type of pump (N)
  * Compound being used (e.g., $\mbox{AlOH}_3$ or $\mbox{NaOH}$) (N)
  * If a kiln is above a critical temperature (true/false) (N)
  * Survey responses (Strongly agree, agree, neutral, ...) (O)


## Example: Palmer Station penguins

```{python}
# | echo: false
import pandas as pd

df = pd.read_csv("../data/palmer-penguins.csv")
df.head()
```


## Indexing variables {.smaller}

* Variables can be indexed by time or space (or both!)
* **Time**
  * Time series data: a sequential set of data points measured over successive times 
  * Common in process plants
  * In a continuous time series observations are measured at every instance of time, whereas a discrete time series contains observations measured at discrete points in time.
* **Space**
  * Spatial measurements can be made at discrete locations, or they can be measurements of a continuous field measured at discrete points
  * Discrete: rainfall at BoM weather stations across WA
  * Continuous: Satellite measurements of atmospheric water vapour
  * Indexed by, e.g., latitude/longitude, eastings/northings
