## Acknowledgement of Country

:::: {.columns}

::: {.column width="50%" style="font-size: 72%"}
We acknowledge all First Nations of this place we call Australia and recognise the many nations who have looked after Country for more than 60,000 years. We are honoured and grateful for the privilege to maintain campuses in Boorloo (Perth) and Karlkurla (Kalgoorlie). We pay our respects to Elders past and present as Custodians and Owners of these lands. We recognise their deep knowledge and their cultural, spiritual and educational practices, and aspire to learn and teach in partnership with them.

# Welcome and housekeeping

## Housekeeping

## The plan

:::: {.columns}

::: {.column width="50%"}
**Day 1**

1. Variables & variable types
2. Extracting & importing data
3. Data cleaning
4. Data visualisation
:::

::: {.column width="50%"}
**Day 2**

1. Linear regression
2. Reliability
3. Time series
4. Logistic regression

:::

::: {style="font-size: 80%"}
Most of the modules will consist of a lecture/discussion component followed by a hands-on workshop using Python. There will time for breaks, lunch, and morning and afternoon tea.
:::

## The plan

::: {style="font-size: 90%"}
* The course is structured as a series of lecture/practical pairs

* Some of the lectures will focus on aspects of Python, but most will focus on principles; practicals will by Python-based

* Guiding philosophy is not to cram too much into two days, but to provide you with a start on learning some principles and tools that you can take back and use in the workplace

* Questions/discussions are encouraged! Each of you brings your own set of experiences to this course that will provide the rest of the group with a different perspective

## About me

![](images/Canada-Australia.png)

::: {style="font-size: 60%"}
* PhD in chemical engineering, but came to statistics through my work as a research engineer working on solid rocket propellants
* Joined Curtin in 2015 after ~20 years working with CSIRO as an applied statistician in industrial statistics, cancer biomarkers, bioinformatics, imaging, and climate research
* For the last 5 years, I've been part of the Centre for Transforming Maintenance through Data Science

* Previous experience with data analysis?

* What would you like to be able to do with data?

* Your expectations of this short-course?



# Why data science? Why now?

## What's the hype?

:::

::: {.column width="60%"}
* What does DS mean?
  * Science of 'big data'?
  * Whatever Facebook, Google, and Amazon do?
* Is it really new?
  * Statistics has been around for a long time!
  * Machine learning algorithms weren't invented last week either

## No neat definition?

## So what is data science anyway?

* "...the latest tech marketing buzzword ...? ([Ray Garcia](https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/what-data-science-anyway-ray-garcia))
* Applied statistics by a different name ([Nate Silver](http://www.statisticsviews.com/details/feature/5133141/Nate-Silver-What-I-need-from-statisticians.html))
* Statistics with a deep understanding of computer science and data engineering? ([Justin Megahan](https://blog.mixpanel.com/2016/03/30/this-is-the-difference-between-statistics-and-data-science/))
* Data science is just what data scientists do! (anon.)


## Data science: Why now? {.smaller}

* From Galileo to TQM to Six Sigma, we've been using data to answer all sorts of questions, but ...
* We now have the capacity to measure and store massive amounts of data, and we have the computing power to analyse it all
  * Data gathered from online tracking: websites visited, clicks
  * Data in other fields: finance, medical records, pharmaceuticals, bioinformatics, social welfare, retail
  * Data on when you log into corporate systems, what sites you visit, how long you stay for
* The challenge is to extract useful information, especially when, as in mining, data can be messy!
* An additional aspect is _reproducibility_: tools are now available to make most aspects of the the data science workflow traceable and reproducible
